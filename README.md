ðŸ§® Dynamic Budgeting Spreadsheet (Google Sheets)
A fully automated personal budgeting system built in Google Sheetsâ€”without using pivot tables or scripts. This project showcases my advanced skills in spreadsheet engineering, leveraging only native formulas to perform:

Data Input & Structuring
Organized capital and expense tracking inputs by week, category, and specifics.

Data Cleaning & Aggregation
Uses functions and simple tables to simulate pivot-table behavior.

Visualization & Analytics
Interactive dashboard that includes:

Weekly and monthly cash flow breakdowns

Category-wise savings/expenses

Real-time bar and pie charts

Trend tracking over time

This project demonstrates how far spreadsheet formulas alone can be pushed to replicate database-like behavior and analytical dashboards.
