## ðŸ’¡ Story & Motivation
Back in college, I kept ending up with a negative balance almost every week. 
That pushed me to take budgeting seriouslyâ€”not just to manage my money better, but also to improve my financial habits.

I started by creating a simple budgeting spreadsheet tailored to my needs. 
Over several months, I kept tweaking and improving it until it became the fully automated tool it is today. 
It's a personal project that grew alongside my journey in financial literacy and spreadsheet skills.

ðŸ§® **Dynamic Budgeting Spreadsheet (Google Sheets)**  
A fully automated personal budgeting tool made in Google Sheetsâ€”no pivot tables or scripts needed!  
I built this using only native formulas to handle everything from input to analytics:

### ðŸ“Œ Input & Organization
- Track income and expenses by week, category, and details.

### ðŸ§¹ Data Cleanup & Summary
- Clean and group data with formulasâ€”like a pivot table, but simpler.

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard & Insights
Includes an interactive dashboard with:
- Weekly and monthly cash flow  
- Spending and savings by category  
- Live bar and pie charts  
- Trends over time
